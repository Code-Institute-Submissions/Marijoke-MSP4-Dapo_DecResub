### Wireframes
I created wireframes using [Adobe XD](https://adobe.ly/3ly9u5e)

[Please see Wireframes here.](LINK)

### Fonts 
The fonts chosen for the website are:
[LATO](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato#standard-styles) The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the strong structure provides stability and seriousness which is how we want customers to see DAPO.

### Colours
I used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) to look up suitable colour schemes. In the end I wwnt with the classic black and white for a simple yet elegant look.
